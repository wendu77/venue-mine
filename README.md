# Venue Mine
Venue Mine is a simple app that queries the Foursquare API for nearby venues based on a zip code and category entered by the user, and allows you to click on links to each venue. This project has no server (Node JS) integration and was therefore a good starting point for me to learn React/Redux only (when I first started getting my feet wet with React). This is a simple project that shows how to integrate Redux and process data from API requests. Enjoy!

## Technologies Used
React, Redux, Webpack, Babel, ES6, Foursquare API
